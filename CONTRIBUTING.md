#### Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/briandk/transcriptase-atom/issues)

I use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](); it's that easy!

#### Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can.
